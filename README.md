# visitmetoday
A full-stack project for managing social media profiles in one place.

##Introduction
Introducing Visitme Today, a comprehensive full-stack project that presents a digital visiting card solution for seamless sharing across diverse platforms.
Upon registration, users are assigned a unique username, automatically generating an exclusive QR code for their profile. For personalized touch, users can also select a custom username if available.

With this project I came to know about various conditions that are necessary for an industry level project.


While working on this project along with Chandan Satyarthi Sir, I learned how URL shorteners work and what are various things to keep in mind while choosing the shortened url length and performing database modeling. I applied this while assigning a unique username to each user and allowing them to have multiple (limited) usernames.

I also worked on error handling and error logging using express middlewares. 
Special focus was placed on API designing and routing.

The project also facilitated an exploration into file validation and the creation of image files via the canvas.

A pivotal insight gained was how companies offload backend server burdens by strategically slowing down the User Interface or by dividing a job into multiple segments when they have to update multiple tables.

Upon completion of both frontend and backend components, attention shifted to hostingâ€”a domain unfamiliar to me.
I could not understand a thing back then. My gratitude extends to @poojan bhaiya and Chandan sir for their invaluable guidance, which helped me understand how the reverse proxies work and their necessity. I was able to host a static website and run a backend server to handle the incoming requests. Now I could comfortably use a reverse proxy to redirect incoming traffic to their respective destination.



This project instilled a newfound fascination with the backend realm. It dawned on me how expansive and accessible backend technology can be. All you need is a good mentor to guide you through the high waves.
